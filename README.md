# Hello ECS
  
Hello my name is Éloi Strée.  
When I am learning a new topic that is heavy, I create a GitHub and use it as notebook.  

- It allows me to help me when I need to study for a second time a old topic
- It allows me to create more easily workshop or lecture  
- It allows to quickly find some links when we ask me help  


My aim here is to apprehend the use of ECS for all my future projects that are AR/VR one in a hybride ways.  
So if you are in the say situation.  
Enjoy.  


It is totaly random and unstored.   
But feel free to enjoy waking in my steps.  

Good luck in your learning.
