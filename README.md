# Hello ECS
  
Hello my name is Éloi Strée.  
When I am learning a new topic that is heavy, I create a GitHub and use it a notebook.  

- It allows me to help me when I need to study for a second time a old topic
- It allows me to create more easily workshop or lecture  
- It allows to quickly find some links when we ask me help  

It is totaly random and unstored.   
But feel free to enjoy waking in my steps.  

Good luck in your learning.
